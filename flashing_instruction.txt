Install Instructions

This assumes you've unlocked your bootloader already... 

If you are upgrading from a previous build or coming from another custom ROM, simply skip to step 7!

1. Install Android SDK Platform tools if you have not installed them already.
⚠️ Do NOT use Minimal ADB and Fastboot or other outdated installers.

If you're on Windows 11 or latest version of Windows 10, winget install Google.PlatformTools is the fastest and a better way to get adb/fastboot that will work globally! 
(winget is preinstalled on these versions)

2. Enable developer options and USB debugging
3. Reboot your device to fastboot mode (NOT bootloader) using adb reboot fastboot

if your device is NOT detected by fastboot on windows, please install the correct drivers for Android Bootloader Interface!


3. Flash the recovery image (Use the 6.1 recovery (Evolution X) if coming from stock!)
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img

4. Reboot your device to bootloader mode
fastboot reboot bootloader

5. Reboot to the new recovery (in fastbootd mode)
fastboot reboot fastboot

6. Wipe super:
fastboot wipe-super super_empty.img
You can find super_empty in notes here!
7. Reboot to bootloader once.
If you have an OTA zip:
8. Enter recovery
9. Choose Apply Update -> Apply from ADB
10. adb sideload /path/to/ota.zip
11. Once complete, you will be asked if you have any additional files to install. if you do not, choose no.
12. Factory reset from the main menu (if you are updating from another version, don't wipe, unless otherwise specified)

Note: Always refer to the phone screen for completion (exit status 0) or errors. Reaching only 47% on sideload and /metadata/ota printing an error after formatting are normal!

Reboot to system from the main menu

if you are updating from an older version and want to root your device, let the device boot unrooted at least once before flashing any patched images!
